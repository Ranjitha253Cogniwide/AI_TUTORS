The two screws looked the same to Sonu. But when he observed them closely, he saw they were of slightly different lengths.\n\nSonu was fascinated by how such a small difference in lengths could matter so much.

He was also curious to know how little the difference was because the screws looked nearly the same.\n\n![](images/5890aa077159714d40b5d1961463617a6899274bb0bc9b2ec6fa1a303521b98d.jpg)",

For this, let us ask ourselves some questions.\n\n1. What can the magic sum be? Can it be any number?\n\nLet us focus, for the moment, only on the row sums. We have seen that in a $3 \\times 3$ grid with numbers 1 – 9, the total of row sums will always be 45. Since in a magic square the row sums are all equal, and they add up to 45, they have to be 15 each. Thus, we have the following observation.",

Hardy had ridden in a taxicab numbered 1729 and he remarked that 1729 was ‘rather a dull number,’ adding that he hoped that this was not a bad sign.
